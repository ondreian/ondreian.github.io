# Change Log

All classes that I add will be namespaced with the string
`--v1`

Grepping the html of a page should reveal where these classes (or elements) were added

## [login page](ondreian.github.io/login.html)

+ Logo moved to a div.span12 above the login form
+ added various --v1 classes
+ removed the .pull-right class from the copyright container (so it could be centered)

## [lesson page](ondreian.github.io/lesson.html)

## [index page](ondreian.github.io/index.html)
